      <h2>🧠 Who I Am</h2>
      <p>
        Hi! I'm <strong>Julian Silva da Cunha</strong>, but online I usually go
        by <strong>Ultimate Mercer</strong> — a name I've carried since my
        gaming days that ended up becoming my personal brand.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm a bit of a reserved and quiet person (something I'm working on), but
        I'm very focused on what I do and always eager to learn something new. I
        like to observe, to create in my own time, and to do things with
        purpose. To me, growth is an ongoing process — and the name{" "}
        <em>Ultimate Mercer</em> reflects that: my constant pursuit of becoming
        a better version of myself.
      </p>

      <h2>💼 What I Do</h2>
      <p>
        These days I mainly work as a <strong>front-end developer</strong>,
        though I’ve been getting more involved with back-end too. I feel more
        comfortable writing code than designing interfaces, but that doesn’t
        mean I’ve let go of design — quite the opposite. Being so close to the
        front-end, I naturally engage with <strong>accessibility</strong>,{" "}
        <strong>interface design</strong>, and <strong>user experience</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve worked in teams, freelanced, and taken on several personal projects
        where I could explore, fail, learn, and grow.

      <h2>🧩 What I Can Do Professionally</h2>
      <p>
        Throughout my journey, I’ve built a solid foundation in web development
        — especially on the front-end — and have been expanding my knowledge in
        back-end, interface design, and authorial projects. Here are some areas
        where I can contribute professionally:
      </p>

      <h3 className="mt-4">1. Front-end Development</h3>
      <p>
        I can create modern, responsive, and accessible web interfaces with a
        focus on performance and user experience. I have hands-on experience
        with frameworks like <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Next.js</strong>,{" "}
        <strong>Vue</strong>, and <strong>Svelte</strong>, as well as libraries
        like <strong>TailwindCSS</strong>, <strong>Shadcn UI</strong>, and
        Bootstrap in previous projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        I usually build interfaces directly in code, which allows me to test
        ideas quickly. I also apply accessibility best practices (a11y) as the
        project evolves and am always looking to improve in that area.
      </p>

      <h3 className="mt-4">2. Back-end Development</h3>
      <p>
        While still growing in this area, I can structure{" "}
        <strong>REST APIs</strong> using tools like <strong>Express</strong>,{" "}
        <strong>NestJS</strong>, and <strong>Fastify</strong>. I’m familiar with
        relational databases, especially <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>, using ORMs
        like <strong>Prisma</strong> and <strong>Drizzle</strong> — based on
        documentation and hands-on practice.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve implemented authentication with <strong>JWT</strong> both on the
        back-end and integrated with solutions like <strong>Auth.js</strong>/
        <strong>NextAuth</strong> on the front-end. I’m also interested in
        trying out new approaches like <strong>better-auth</strong> and
        frameworks such as <strong>Hono</strong> as I move forward.
      </p>

      <h3 className="mt-4">3. Deployment & Infrastructure</h3>
      <p>
        I have experience using <strong>Docker</strong> for local environments
        (databases, Redis) and deploying through <strong>GitHub Actions</strong>{" "}
        for static projects, as well as <strong>Vercel</strong> for dynamic
        applications. I’m working on deepening my understanding of local
        infrastructure and continuous deployment.
      </p>

      <h3 className="mt-4">4. Interface Design & Visual Identity</h3>
      <p>
        With a background in Digital Design, I can contribute to UI/UX decisions
        — even though I’m still rebuilding my confidence in that area. I enjoy
        adapting visual references and exploring variations, creating solutions
        that balance clarity, style, and identity.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m also improving my skills in tools like Figma and have a good
        critical sense to propose design improvements and collaborate with
        multidisciplinary teams.
      </p>

      <h3 className="mt-4">5. Content, Authorial Projects & Collaboration</h3>
      <p>
        I have experience with personal projects like <strong>Blklight</strong>,
        where I experiment with new ideas in design and development. I’ve
        written a few articles (writing is still something I find challenging)
        and want to grow in this area to better share what I’ve learned.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m also open to collaborating in small teams or independent projects —
        especially those that combine{" "}
        <strong>technology, creativity, and purpose</strong>.
      </p>
      <h2>📘 My Journey</h2>
      <p>
        My tech journey started in 2013 when I enrolled in{" "}
        <strong>Sistemas para Internet at IFSul</strong>. That’s where I had my
        first contact with programming and the web, and I realized how much I
        enjoyed creating. I graduated in 2016 and, despite some early career
        struggles, I kept learning and building on my own.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2017, I decided to broaden my perspective and joined the{" "}
        <strong>Digital Design program at UFPel</strong>. I wanted to understand
        how to bring together the technical and the visual, and design helped me
        better understand usability, visual hierarchy, accessibility — things
        that now shape how I work as a dev.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the pandemic in 2020, I fully committed to development and grew a
        lot through hands-on experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Early projects that helped shape me include an anime website and another
        for exam questions. Since then, I’ve kept my portfolio and{" "}
        <strong>Blklight</strong> active — with breaks and comebacks along the
        way, as life goes.
      </p>
      <p>
        What I’ve learned through it all is that{" "}
        <em>I love creating, experimenting, and learning</em> — and that I need
        to keep working on my confidence, learning how to show what I build and
        speak up about what I believe in.
      </p>

      <h2>🧪 Personal Projects & Brand</h2>
      <h3 className="mt-4">🔦 Blklight</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Blklight</strong> is my most important personal project. It
        started as a playground but evolved into a{" "}
        <strong>
          platform for content, experimentation, and ongoing learning
        </strong>
        . There I share articles, components, ideas, and everything that blends
        design, code, and creative thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
        The name comes from <em>blacklight</em> — the kind that reveals what’s
        hidden. It’s a metaphor I really like because Blklight is all about
        revealing what usually stays behind the scenes.
      </p>
      <h3 className="mt-4">👁 Ultimate Mercer</h3>
      <p>
        The name <strong>Ultimate Mercer</strong> reflects a lot of who I am:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>Ultimate</em> represents my drive for continuous growth.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Mercer</em> is inspired by a character who adapts and evolves —
          something that resonates with me deeply.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The brand symbol looks like an eye — some say a Pokéball (which I love).
        It represents{" "}
        <strong>
          versatility, detail orientation, and the balance between logic and
          creativity
        </strong>{" "}
        — right where I like to be.
      </p>
      <h3 className="mt-4">💡 Other Projects</h3>
      <p>
        I built a GitHub data viewer using <strong>Svelte</strong> and started a
        site exploring the lore of <em>Mass Effect</em> — a project I hope to
        continue soon.
      </p>

      <h2>🚀 Where I’m Headed</h2>
      <p>
        I want to keep growing as a developer — especially in the{" "}
        <strong>back-end</strong>, but also visually, improving my{" "}
        <strong>UI and UX</strong> skills. My goal is to become more
        well-rounded and capable of building complete experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m looking for projects that have purpose — that combine{" "}
        <strong>design, code, and real-world impact</strong>. I also plan to
        finish my Digital Design degree, which has been essential to how I see
        product development.
      </p>
      <p>
        More than just work, I want <strong>satisfaction</strong> in what I do,
        to use my skills to pursue dreams, support my family, and build a
        meaningful career.
      </p>

      <h2>🌱 Outside the Code</h2>
      <p>
        When I’m not coding or designing, I’m probably listening to music
        (depends on the mood), reading fiction, watching old series, gaming, or
        sketching out new project ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
        A character that inspires me is <strong>Goku</strong> — not because of
        strength, but for his drive to improve, face challenges with a light
        heart, and give his best.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        "<em>Divided we fall, united we stand.</em>"
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        That quote reminds me that even when working solo, it’s through
        collaboration that we grow the most.
