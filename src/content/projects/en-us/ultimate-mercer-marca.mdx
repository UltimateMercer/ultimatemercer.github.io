Creating a personal brand goes beyond having a name or a logo. It's about representing who I am and how I work. **Ultimate Mercer** arose from this need: something that translates my journey and my way of uniting design and development.

## **Where does the name come from?**

The name **Ultimate Mercer** has two important meanings for me:

- **"Ultimate"** represents my constant pursuit of learning and evolution.
- **"Mercer"** was inspired by a character with adaptive abilities, something I see a lot in my work when transitioning between different areas.

In the end, the name reflects well my approach of always exploring new paths and connecting knowledge.

## **Full Stack Designer – Uniting Design and Code**

My professional role fits the concept of a **Full Stack Designer**, which basically means:

- **Creating functional interfaces** (UI/UX).
- **Transforming these ideas into real code** in front-end development.

This mix allows me to have a more complete view of the projects, ensuring that design and implementation make sense together.

## **The Symbol and Its Interpretations**

The brand's symbol was created to represent an **eye**, something that refers to observation and perception. But, interestingly, some people associated it with a **Pokéball**. This ambiguity ended up being interesting, as it brings an alternative and unexpected meaning, making the symbol more flexible and unique.

## **Visual Identity**

Some visual elements help reinforce the brand's identity:

- **Typography**: Use of the **Barlow** font, bringing a clean and modern look.
- **Colors**: Chosen to maintain consistency and give personality to the design.

## **A brand that evolves with me**

**Ultimate Mercer** is not something fixed, it continues to evolve as I do. More than a name or a logo, it's a way to represent my work and my way of seeing design and development.
