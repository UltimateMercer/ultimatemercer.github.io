Recently, while reading some articles, I came across a project where a developer used the GitHub API to search for a username and display basic information about the user. Inspired by this, I decided to create my own version of this application, aiming to include more detailed information about the user.

To develop this application, I used some current technologies, including:

- **Svelte/SvelteKit**: I had already tested Svelte before and always had an interest in creating a complete project with it. I find Svelte similar to Vue, my first framework and the one I worked with professionally.
- **Octokit and GitHub API**: to access GitHub data, I used Octokit, which makes searches easier and allows for a larger number of requests with authentication.
- **@tanstack/query**: essential for better managing searches and caching data.
- **Shadcn-svelte**: as I like to use ShadcnUI with React/Next.js, I opted for a version compatible with Svelte, with easy-to-use components and styling with TailwindCSS.
- **Vercel**: I used it for deployment. Normally, I create static sites with GitHub Pages, but in this case, the application requires dynamic data searches, so Vercel was more suitable.
- **v0**: I used this AI as a basis for creating the contribution display component and for configuring contribution and repository queries in GraphQL. As v0 is targeted at React, I had to adjust the component to work correctly in Svelte.
- **Lucide Icons, Phosphor Icons and Inter font**: I chose these icon libraries and the Inter font for the overall typography of the application.

The application is available at [https://githubdata.ultimatemercer.com/](https://githubdata.ultimatemercer.com/?un=ultimatemercer).

You can also access it with a predefined username, for example: [https://githubdata.ultimatemercer.com/?un=ultimatemercer](https://githubdata.ultimatemercer.com/?un=ultimatemercer). This way, when loading the site, it already displays the user's data.

I performed a performance test with Lighthouse to check performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO, and got excellent results. Although there is a slight oscillation in performance, the initial results were better than I expected, given that I didn't focus much on performance optimization.

Developing this project was a valuable experience, both in terms of learning and using tools. One area for improvement would be the planning phase, as I had to refactor the structure to integrate @tanstack/query.

### Next Steps

I still want to improve some points in the project (I took a break for now). The main points to work on are:

- Add unit tests;
- Improve data loading with a predefined username;
- Adjust some design details.
