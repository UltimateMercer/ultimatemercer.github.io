Blklight has always been a space for experimentation, learning and growth. From the beginning, the idea was to combine design and development in a practical way, testing concepts and improving skills. Now, it's time to take a step forward: **the All New Blklight**.

## **What changed?**

Blklight has undergone a complete redesign, from the visual to the project structure. The idea is to make it more intuitive, faster and ready to grow. Some of the main changes are:

- **Redesigned interface** - Everything has been rethought to have a more fluid and enjoyable navigation.
- **More solid components** - The project structure has been adjusted to facilitate future improvements.
- **More integrated content** - Articles, projects and professionals now connect in a more natural way.

## **Why this change?**

Blklight has always followed my professional growth. With time, I realized that it needed to grow with me. This new phase is about making the project more organized, functional and open to new possibilities.

## **What's next?**

The All New Blklight is still under construction, but some new features are already being thought out for the future:

- A more complete section for **articles and studies**.
- Better organization for **projects and collaborations**.
- New ideas for **expanding the community** in the future.

This version marks an important moment for me: **Blklight is now the theme of my TCC**. Soon, I'll share more details about the process, design decisions and next steps.
